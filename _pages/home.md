## Our Vision

The mission of the TRUstworthy CYBER system (TRUCYBER) lab is to carry out transformative research to advance the security aspects of cyber infrastructure and design/develop decentralized trustworthy systems by addressing the underlying fundamental security challenges. Being a strong believer of cross-disciplinary research, TRUCYBER lab rigorously incorporates distributed and decentralized design methodologies, such as blockchain, to enable trust and provenance in the next generation cyber systems. Members of this lab exploit concepts form distributed systems, network theory, mechanism design, human society inspired evolutionary models, and behavioral dynamics to design secure yet robust solutions that are fundamental to IoT and cyber physical systems. In particular, TRUCYBER lab conducts basic and applied research in following core domains:

1. Secure Cyber Physical Systems Environment: Self-sovereign identity management, Secure and privacy-aware information dissemination, Privilege management, Lightweight consensus mechanism for compute-constrained IoT nodes, Supply chain provenance, Blockchain for fast responder networks, Scalable and Lightweight Blockchain integrated IoT, Access control policy design

2. Distributed Trust and Data Provenance: Immutable and auditable provenance using Blockchain, Admission control, Incentive-compatible Blockchain consensus model design, Decentralized resource management, Off-chain analysis of provenance data, vulnerability analysis of Blockchain integrated cloud platform, Scalability issues, Transactional efficiency

3. Facilitating Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure: Information integrity, Anonymity and privacy preservation, Malicious insider detection, Membership management, Dynamic access control, Incentive design toward enhancing trust, Information quality assessment for cyber-insurers, Extended frameworks for Healthcare data sharing and management, Interoperability among multiple sharing systems, Deriving threat-intelligence.
