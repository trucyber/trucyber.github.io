# Research

Assurance of data transfer within intra-cloud and inter-cloud environments is very crucial. Typical assurance of data focuses on ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data contents. However, assurance of the ancestry of the data (where the data came from) is a challenge in cloud environments. Data provenance addresses such issue based on the detailed derivation of data objects. If true data provenance existed in the cloud for all data stored on cloud storage, distributed data computations, data exchanges and transactions, detecting insider attacks, reproducing research results, and identifying the exact source of system/network intrusions would be achievable. In this project, we focus on developing a cloud based data provenance framework using blockchain that tracks all data operations and maintains the provenance data in an immutable manner. The provenance data gets anchored on the blockchain by keeping user privacy under consideration. A preliminary prototype of this architecture has been developed in ownCloud and is available in form of a web service.
